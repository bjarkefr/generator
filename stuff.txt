TopLevel Parameters:
	- Tech level?

Mission
	- How are missions selected? Requested, Generated with special missions for rare gear etc, Can you randomly generate as many ass you like untill you get the one you want.. etc...
	- There should be unexpected missions: Where you have to espace without the usual equipment etc..
	- Overall mission (keep in mind that mission area can be very large with big facilities and many ships, of which few may actually be involved in the actual plan...!)
	- What are we trying to steal. I guess the players cannot decide this on their own because this would make it impossible to create an interesting mission-problem.
	- There can however be a number of optional objectives.
	- What level of information is available at the very beginning before first visit to the mission area...?
	- What are we trying to optimize for? Clean missions with no detection or casual ties.. or? Why have demolition experts then...?
	- First mission should be: Steal the captains bible
	
Events:
	- The players can visit the mission area as many times as they like. However things should get very hard on subsequent visits if the are discovered.
	- After each visit to the mission area a number of things could change. Players MAY be completely or partly notified. (skill dependent?)

Target(s)
	- Type - Station, Ship, other Facility
	- Faction
	- Race(s) (depend on factions)
	- Role (roles and their probability depend on faction)
	- Interior type. Looks/style/
	- Specialization, if generic craft. Generic vessel, specialization Cargo
	- Hull/Building, actual ship hull - Hull options. Especially asymetric vessels may have som strange hull options. Ekstra crew pods along the side. etc. Different engine placements.
	- now interior size is know

	- Layout:
		- Rectangular unless something else is demanded by outside hull. Some factions have Voronoi-Diagram based rooms.
		- Rooms (Primarily - Role and size, dictate what rooms are mandatory):
			- Primary
				- Bridge
				- Transporter / Reception
				- Docking bay
				- Docking port / Airlock
				- Workshop
				- Science
				- Cargo
				- Crew storage
				- Quarters
				- Weapon rooms - for drones, missions, etc.
				- Secondary version of the above
			- Filler - This distinction of rooms suck. Perhaps a dependecy tree. The first room of a spaceship is alwas the bridge etc...
				- Holo decks
				- Recreational
					- Garden/Tranquil rooms
				- Escape pod (another escape route)
				- Armory
		- Halls
			- Connection routing...?

Procedure and AI behaviour:
	- Each AI has purpose, goals etc. Each AI has a number of interaction interfaces. E.g.: AIOfficial (can be asked by players and other AIs what todo in case of emergency etc). Other AI actively seek out officials in certain situations...
	- Especially crew has procedures they follow.
			
			
Gameplay:
	- You normally need a reson to have access to the missions area. The AI will judge you actions in light of this reason. If you are visiting scientist to a conference, you can move more freely than if you are an "expert" supposed to fix some computer problem and then leave.
	- If you stand around not doing anything (you could talk to someone, even another player etc.). The Ai is likely to ask you annoying questions about your reason for doing so etc.
	- Somewhat easier to defend a position than to fight you way to a new. Sometimes you can "buy time" by fighting, but it should be hard to complete main objectives guns blazing.
			
Crew/Staff:
	- Security
	- Technical
	- Command
	- Support - chef, 
	- Civilians - Passenger, visitors etc.
	- 

Interactive objects:
	- Security devices, cameras, other sensors
	- Computer terminals
	- Access points (not the wifi ones)
	- Transporters (requires control from terminal?)

	- Pick-up-able:
		- Tools
		- Keycard (low tech level)
		- Com-badge (low tech)
		- Data-pads
		- Common items - mugs, plates

Try generating:
Try generating the problem the players must solve by generating X number of solutions to it, and then add a significant amount of noise.
How does this match the fact that players gain access to ever more powerful equipment...?



Players:

Group resources: (preferable to individual player resources.) 
	- Each group must gain access to new equipment by buying or stealing it.
	- Meta resources. Better intel channels (missions: more to select from etc., more info about each).
	- Money to buy equipment and other stuff? (Lets keep one time usage expenses to a minimum. We are not trying to hardvest $$$, or am I?)

Players:
	- The usual: Gender, Race, etc.
	- 2-Part Class system: Role class and action class.
	- Role classes:
		- Technician
			- Software
			- Electronics
			- Security
			- Big power
			- Explosives
	- Make characters FEEL their class. Explosives experts can set direction and power of charge. And can asses materials resistance to blasts + if they will catch fire etc etc...
